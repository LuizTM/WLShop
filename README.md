### WLShop was built segregate in some modules, like
------------------------------------------------------------
Root project 'WLShop' project's view
------------------------------------------------------------
```kotlin
Root project 'WLShop'
+--- Project ':app' ---> Main Application of our App
+--- Project ':shared' ---> Shared library to be consumed for ours libraries.
|    +--- Project ':shared:sa-analytics' ---> Responsible by share our tracking logic between modules 
|    +--- Project ':shared:sa-data' ---> Responsible by share our persistence logic between modules
|    +--- Project ':shared:sa-network' ---> Responsible by share our made network logic between modules
|    \--- Project ':shared:ui-ds' ---> Responsible by share our base tokens and themes design system between modules
